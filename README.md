# kubernetes-essential-containers
Mocks the concept of essential containers from ECS in Kubernetes. Useful when the main container completes and side cars keep running.

Example - main app container exits but the connection pooler side car keeps running.

## Description
This project has been bootstrapped using kube-builder framework. 

The code essentially checks for container status to change from `Running` to `Terminated` and reason for termination is `Completed`. This filters out reasons like container crashing etc.

The controller only watches for pods with label `essential-containers` and treat the container mentioned in label value as essential container. Once this main container exits (with exit code 0 - success/completed), we will delete the pod (because there is no stop pod method).

## Commans used for the project bootstrap

```sh
kubebuilder init --repo github.com/sumanthkumarc/kubernetes-essential-containers
kubebuilder create api --kind Pod --controller --version=v1 --group=core
```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Testing on local

Set the `KUBECONFIG` env variable to your remote cluster kubeconfig.
Use the `make run` command to run the controller.

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kubernetes-essential-containers:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kubernetes-essential-containers:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
